# Untitled - GDSC Solution Challenge - Education for All

## Overview

This project aims to develop a gamified multilingual education website for primary education.

## SDGs Covered

1. **Quality Education**: Providing a platform that ensures quality education by making learning enjoyable and interactive.
  
2. **Gender Equality**: Focusing on countries like where certain communities, particularly women, face discrimination in accessing education.

3. **Reduced Inequalities**: Bridging the educational gap by reaching out to marginalized groups, such as refugee children and those in underprivileged communities.

## Problem Statement

The mission of the Solution Challenge is to solve for one or more of the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals using Google technology.

## Use Cases

1. **Refugee Children**: For kids of refugees in host countries, the platform becomes a valuable tool for learning in their local language, fostering a sense of familiarity and comfort.

2. **Gender Discrimination in Education**: In countries where certain communities, particularly women, face discrimination in education, this platform provides a means for them to understand essential concepts in a gamified way from the safety of their homes.

3. **NGO Partnerships**: Collaboration with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can extend the reach of the platform to children who may not have access to quality education. This can be especially beneficial for those not enrolled in schools or attending schools with inadequate education standards.

## Integration with Google Products

The project leverages various Google products to enhance its functionality and reach:

1. **Google Translate**: Ensures content is available in multiple languages, breaking down language barriers and making education accessible to a broader audience.

2. **Bard**: Incorporating Bard for audio support, aiding users with different learning preferences and abilities.

3. **Google Classroom**: Utilizing Google Classroom to facilitate the seamless integration of the platform into educational institutions, enabling teachers to monitor progress and engagement.
